explanation for the testcases:

01-02: targeted at testing the static analysis wit everything in multiple functions
tests 03 to 09 target the implementation of the communication
03 non-contiguous datatype
04 other communicator than world
05 multiple requests
06 very basic test
07-09 different orderings of wait to check implementation for deadlock
10 statically unknown tag number, but provably same
11 statically unknown tag number, possibly same
12 uses different functions via functionptr to set up communication 
13 usage of a function ptr
14 usage of a cpp object
15 inheritance with virtual table
16 inheritance with virtual table - tag is a different obj member in other subclass
17 Waitall only on the sends and only after that Waitall on the recvs (tests communication Implementation)
18 same as 16 but with For Loop over object members
19 Reinitialization of Requests I
20 Reinitialization of Requests II
21 Reading from file but unrelated to message tags
22 Reading tags from file
23 Catch exception and use different tag in this case
24 output to std::cout with multiple chained << commands
25 multiple calls to MPI get rank wrapper but only one cll is important
26 ArgsReader Class
27 inharitance with a std::shared_ptr as a global variable
cmake-c the pass should process the cmake sample snipped used to determine mpi version
cmake-cpp
