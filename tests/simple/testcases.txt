explanation for the testcases:

01-02: targeted at testing the static analysis wit everything in multiple functions
other tests target the implementation
03 non contigous datatype
04 other communicator than wolrd
05 multiple requests
06 very basic test
07-09 different orderings of wait to check implementation for deadlock
10 statically unkown tag number, but provably same
11 statically unkown tag number, possibly same
12 uses different functions via functionptr to set up communication
